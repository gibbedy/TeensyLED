// TeensyLED Audio DMX Master
// Version 0.9
// Copyright Brian Neltner 2016
//
// Description:
//
// This program is designed for use with the SaikoLED TeensyLED Driver
// system, using the ADM2582E from Analog Devices to provide a fully
// isolated RS485/DMX-512 interface which has been demonstrated as both
// a DMX master and DMX slave device.
//
// TeensyLED Board Design Files (EagleCAD) and some other libraries can
// be found at:
// https://github.com/saikoLED/TeensyLED
//
// A jumper is available on the TeensyLED board to allow switching between
// the formal DMX-512a spec for DMX over RJ45/CAT5 cabling and the Color
// Kinetics version of the standard, which switches DATA- and DATA+ and the
// shield/ground connections.
//
// Reference:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMX512#RJ-45_pinout
//
// This program assumes that line level audio (~1V peak-to-peak) is
// available, and wired to analog input 0 on the Teensy 3.1 (on the
// TeensyLED, this is available on JP1. In this example, A0 is connected
// to 3.3V and GND via 100k resistors to provide a mid-scale DC offset
// and then a capacitor is used to connect the audio input to AO.
//
// As such, you end up with a capacitively coupled audio signal centered
// at mid-scale. There are other ways to accomplish this with higher
// fidelity, but for this purpose the audio quality is not particularly
// important as it is never output to speakers and is only used for
// controlling the lighting.
//
// The basic algorithm below utilizes the SaikoLED HSI to RGB system to
// convert a hue-saturation-intensity color to RGB which is then output
// to standard RGB lighting. RGBW lighting could be used by switching
// to the SaikoLED HSI->RGBW code, or using the new full CIE color
// correction algorithm specifically designed to allow the TeensyLED to
// control many-wavelength devices such as the LEDEngin LZ7 series LED
// that provides RAGCBVW LEDs.
//
// LEDEngin LZ7 LED and CIE Color Correction.
// http://blog.saikoled.com/post/133625978643/full-cie-color-correction-with-the-teensy-31
//
// For this audio analysis effect, the hue of the LED light is constantly
// rotating, with beat detection utilized to cause pulses in the lighting.
// Volume normalization is accomplished by saving the maximum audio signal
// seen when the signal exceeds the prior maximum, but then gradually
// letting the max signal level decay back to a low value over time so that
// it can both immediately respond to volume increases, and recognize
// when the audio has gotten quieter.
//
// This effect also accomplishes automatic thresholding for the derivitive
// of the audio signal for beat detection -- you select a target estimate
// for the number of beats per second you'd like to see, and it gradually
// tunes the threshold to the actual audio received to achieve roughly that
// number of detection events. This works effectively to allow the user
// to switch between very different music genres without needing to reprogram
// a pile of magic constants to get it to look good.
//
// Upon beat detection, the intensity of the lights immediately increases to
// the normalized volume seen during that beat. As such, a loud beat in a soft
// section of music will cause the light to flash brightly while a soft beat
// in a loud section will appear more as a subtle flash. This results in a 
// very nice effect wherein a loud beat followed by several soft accent beats
// (very common in music of all kinds) shows the complexities of the beat
// pattern very intuitively.
//
// After a beat detection, the light brightness gradually decays -- the light
// turning on is immediate but the decay takes ~100ms which gives a nice shape
// that matches most drum signals very naturally. This decay time also varies
// automatically based on the number of beats in the song. If a song has many
// many beats the decay time is short so that the beats appear visually cleaner
// to match the feeling of the music.
//
// In this example code, I demonstrate controlling 8 DMX lights which are
// arranged in a color wheel so that the entire array rotates around while
// pulsing synchronously.
//
// This rough algorithm was first demonstrated in 2013:
// http://blog.saikoled.com/post/44823088119/myki-prototype-with-direct-audio-analysis
// and the improved algorithm below was first demonstrated in 2016 at the
// Firefly Arts Festival.
//
// This software requires the DmxSimple library which uses bit-banging of
// DMX outputs and does not support RDM or other advanced DMX features.
// However, the ADM2582E and Teensy 3.1 should be perfectly capable of using
// these features if a better library becomes available.
//
// Filtering is used throughout this code, using explonential smoothing as a
// very fast and simple way to accomplish a low-pass filter.
//
// Reference:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing
//
// An example is:
//
// audioZero = 0.999999*audioZero + 0.000001*audioSignal;
//
// which takes the prior zero and mixes it with the instantaneous
// audio value to get a low-pass filtered zero. The two constants must
// always add to one, but the larger the 0.000001 value is the more
// quickly the filtered version will adjust to changes.
//
// I am not good at C flags, but there are commented out serial communication
// lines that can be uncommented for debug information (for instance, printing
// the audio RMS values and beat detection values for tuning and debugging
// audio signal issues). Some of this should probably be better encapsulated
// in a C++ style class to reduce the unabstracted complexity of the effects.
